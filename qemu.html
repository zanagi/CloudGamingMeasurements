			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				To install Qemu, first go to the <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Download" target="_blank">Qemu download page</a> and download the newest Qemu
				version (or any version >= 1.7.0). After download, unpack Qemu and go to the newly created folder location. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then you configure Qemu and build it:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				./configure
				<br>
				make 
			</p>
			<p>Then install Qemu with:</p>
			<p class="code">sudo make install</p>
		</div>
		<div id="passthrough">
			<h2>PCI Passthrough</h2>
			<p>
				PCI passthrough allows you to give a virtual machine access to your host computer's graphics cards.
				PCI Passthrough can be enabled by following the instructions on
				<a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Multiheaded-NVIDIA-Gaming-using-Ubuntu-14-04-KVM-585/" target="_blank">
				Matt Bach's post</a> on Puget Systems webpage.
				<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that on the <i>Step 4: Create virtual disk(s)</i>, instead of creating a raw image, you might want to create an image in
				qcow2 format by running the following command (replace <i>name.img</i> with the image name and <i>size</i> with the image
				size that you want i.e 50G):
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				qemu-img create -f qcow2 <i>name.img</i> <i>size</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason for this is that qcow2 format supports <a href="#snapshots">live snapshotting</a> while raw format does not.
			</p>
			<p>
				In case following the instructions doesn't work, here's a list of things that you could try:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Update kernel</li>
				<li>Change the version of Qemu 
				(you can also clone and build from the <a href="http://git.qemu.org/qemu.git" target="_blank">Qemu Git tree</a>)</li>
				<li>Update to Ubuntu 14.04 if using you're using an older version</li>
				<li>Check if your error matches the ones 
				mentioned <a href="http://vfio.blogspot.fi/2014/08/vfiovga-faq.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>

			<h2>NVIDIA Cards</h2>
			<p>
				When passing a non-Quadro NVIDIA card to the VM, you might notice that after installing the Nvidia drivers, 
				your display manager fails to start. In other words, you have no GUI.
				<a href="http://vfio.blogspot.fi/2014/08/vfiovga-faq.html" target="_blank">Apparently</a>
				this is due to an unintentional bug where the Nvidia driver is disabled if KVM is detected.
				The way to fix this, as mentioned on the link, is to add <i>kvm=off</i> to the list of cpu options on Qemu. 
				However, using this option might sometimes cause some weird acceleration where a single key press is processed multiple
				times and graphical applications run "faster" than normally. This is extremely annoying especially when benchmarking since
				the acceleration causes the software to detect the FPS rate much lower than it should be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's how to fix this for a single startup on a Ubuntu VM with Nvidia drivers installed:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. If your VM doesn't support hibernation start the VM and follow the instructions
				<a href="http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/enable-hibernate-ubuntu-14-04/" target="_blank">here</a>
				to enable hibernation.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Stop and exit the VM.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Start the VM <b>without</b> the <i>kvm=off</i> option. You should be greeted either with the terminal or 
				a black screen (in which case press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to enter terminal) without GUI. Login from the terminal and then
				hibernate your machine:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				sudo pm-hibernate
			</p>
			<p>
				4. After confirming that your VM has powered off, exit from it and then start it again, but this time
				<b>with</b> the <i>kvm=off</i> option. You should be greeted with the same terminal where you left before.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Disable and then enable the nvidia module:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				sudo modprobe -r nvidia <br>
				sudo modprobe nvidia
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Then start your display manager:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				sudo service lightdm start
			</p>
			<p>
				And voila! Your VM should now be able to display the GUI without the annoying acceleration, even with Nvidia drivers
				installed. Unfortunately we haven't found any other solutions to this bug and the processed above need to be done each time
				the machine is started. Hopefully Nvidia decides to fix it soon or someone finds a better solution for it.

			<h2>Snapshots</h2>
			<p>
				Qemu allows you to perform live migration of the VM by creating snapshots. Creating snapshots is supported for images
				in qcow2 format. Unfortunately, if a card was passed to the VM using <a href="#passthrough">PCI passthrough</a>
				the snapshot creation will most likely fail.
			</p>
			<p>
				If PCI passthrough is not used snapshots can be created from the Qemu monitor terminal (can be switched into from Qemu
				by pressing Ctrl+Alt+2, can be switched back by pressing Ctrl+Alt+1) with the command:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				savevm <i>id</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that snapshot creation might take a while, especially when the VM (image) has received lots of changes since the boot,
				such as software installation.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can check existing snapshots with:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				info snapshots
			</p>
			<p>
				You can load a snapshot with:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				loadvm <i>id</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				If creating a new snapshot while you have an existing snapshot freezes the VM, you might have to delete the old snapshot.
				At least in our case, we could only have one snapshot at a time without the VM freezing.
