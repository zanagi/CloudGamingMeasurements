CloudGamingMeasurements is a website containing GPU & CPU benchmark results for two cloud gaming solutions: Qemu (KVM)
and Docker (Linux containers).

The results are loaded from text files in *measurements* folder through the script *js/loadresults.js*. The script is
called in the *.html* files with the necessary filename (without file extension) as the parameter.

The website also contains basic instructions for Qemu/Docker installation.
